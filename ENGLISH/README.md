**1. What is TCE and how does it differ from TCO?**

* TCO = “Total Cost of Ownership” — this refers to all the costs associated with acquiring, operating and maintaining an asset (for data centres, this might include hardware purchase, installation, power/operations, cooling, maintenance, etc.).
* TCE = “Total Cost to the Environment” — this is a broader metric that attempts to capture the environmental externalities of an asset or operation. For data centres, that includes greenhouse gas emissions, e-waste, cooling energy, embodied energy in manufacturing, etc.
* In effect, TCE complements TCO by adding the “hidden” environmental costs that might not show up on the balance sheet but have real impact (e.g., carbon emissions, toxic waste, resource depletion). The video you shared focuses on this shift in thinking.
* So: TCO is about the owner’s costs; TCE is about the environmental costs (and by extension societal costs) of the same infrastructure.

**2. What percentage of greenhouse gases are caused by data centres?**

* There is some variation in the literature depending on how you define “data centres” (just IT equipment vs. networks vs. transmission) and what scope of emissions you include (operational only vs. lifecycle).
* Some sources estimate data centres (and data transmission networks) account for about ~1% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
* Other sources provide higher estimates: e.g., ~2.5% to ~3.7% of global GHG emissions for the broader “digital infrastructure” including data centres + networks. 
* For example: one source says data centres and data transmission networks are responsible for “nearly 1 % of energy-related GHG emissions”.
* So a good way to say it: somewhere **around 1%**, possibly up to **2-4%** if you include more of the digital ecosystem.

**3. What is an example of the benefits of Green Computing for NASA scientists?**

* One benefit: On the NASA website: “Earth scientists are reaping huge benefits from research performed on NASA’s advanced supercomputers,” including modelling ocean circulation and climate. 
* More specifically: By using efficient computing/infrastructure (i.e., “green computing” practices) NASA can:

  * Run more simulations with less energy, which means more science for less cost and less environmental impact.
  * Use computing resources to model climate, weather, spacecraft performance, etc (see “5 Ways Supercomputing is Key to NASA Mission Success” article)
  * For example: one system allowed modelling Earth’s ocean climate more accurately and with improved efficiency.
* So a concise example: By implementing more energy-efficient IT infrastructure, NASA scientists can run larger/more detailed climate models with lower energy consumption, thereby supporting climate change research while minimizing environmental footprint.

**4. How much e-waste is produced yearly?**

* According to the Global E‑Waste Monitor 2024: In 2022, a record ~62 million tonnes (Mt) of electronic waste (e-waste) were generated globally.
* The growth trend: It is on track to reach ~82 million tonnes by 2030. 
* Earlier figure: ~53.6 Mt in 2019. 
* So: yearly, tens of millions of tonnes—**~60 million tonnes per year** (as of 2022) globally.

**5. What percentage of global energy consumption is used by data centres?**

* According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) and other recent sources: data centres currently account for about **1.5%** of global energy usage. 
* Other sources say about ~3% of global electricity consumption for data centres. 
* So a good range: **~1-3%** of global energy consumption is used by data centres (the lower number is more conservative and recent).
* If you want to be specific: ~1.5% is widely cited at present.

**6. What is resource saving architecture?**

* “Resource-saving architecture” in the context of data centres/IT refers to designing systems so that hardware, cooling, power and resource usage are optimised, modularised and refreshed less often, thereby saving material resources, energy, e-waste and cost.
* For example: the article “Cool running: … with liquid cooling and resource-saving architectures” describes how resource-saving architecture enables targeted component upgrades rather than full system replacements, reducing e-waste and cost. (
* Also: the white paper from Supermicro on “Resource-Saving architecture” describes disaggregating CPU/memory/subsystems so each resource can be refreshed independently, thus reducing refresh cycle costs and environmental impact. 
* So: Resource-saving architecture = designing IT/data centre infrastructure to be modular, flexible, efficiently upgradeable and resource-efficient, thereby reducing material consumption, energy, cooling demand, e-waste and environmental footprint.

**7. Why is there a relationship between the temperature a server can operate at and its energy usage?**

* Servers generate heat when they process workloads. The higher the workload (or the less efficient the hardware), the more heat produced. That means the cooling system must work harder, consuming more energy.
* Studies indicate that ambient (inlet) temperature impacts both server power consumption and cooling system power consumption. For example: an increase in ambient temperature can increase server power consumption due to increased fan speeds, leakage currents, etc. 
* On the flip side: if you allow the data centre to operate at a higher temperature within safe limits, you can reduce the cooling load (chillers, fans, pumps) and thus reduce energy usage. Many data centres are increasing their allowable operating temperature to save energy. 
* Example: One study found a server room temperature sensitivity of ~0.35-0.5% increased server power per °C of inlet temperature rise. 
* But: there's a trade-off: if the temperature gets too high, reliability and component lifetime can suffer. So you need to strike a balance: raise the temperature enough to save energy on cooling, but keep it low enough to maintain reliability and performance.
* So in summary: the relationship exists because server hardware and cooling systems both respond to operating temperature — higher temps → less efficient hardware (more fan/ leakage/thermal stress) plus typically higher cooling energy; lower temps → more cooling energy, but less stress on servers. Optimising the inlet and ambient temperatures capitalises on this interplay to reduce total energy usage.
